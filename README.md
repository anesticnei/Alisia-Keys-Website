# Alicia Keys Website Recreation

This project is a recreation of the Alicia Keys website UI that I discovered on Dribbble. While it's not an identical replica of the official website, it served as a great source of inspiration for me to experiment with my coding skills.

One of the most challenging parts of this project was creating the logo "Alicia Keys" scaling effect. It took me some time to figure out how to get it right, especially in terms of making sure it didn't overflow the screen. I had to find the user's screen width and apply that to the logo, so it would fit perfectly. As users scroll down, the logo gradually becomes smaller and remains in place, just to the navigation bar.

In addition to this, I implemented sticky sections that remain at the top of the page, around 300px above the actual top of the page. While there aren't many features on this page, it still looks aesthetically pleasing. Do note, however, that this is an unfinished project.
