# Alisia-Keys re-creation.

This is not identical website, what you can see on the official Alisia Keys Website,
but when I was looking for inspiration on dribbble, I found out someone re-create UI of this web,
so i try to re-create this web but using code.

Logo "Alicia Keys" scaling effect got me sometime to figure out how to make it correctrly, because many times a had problems with this.
First how to find users width of the screen, then apply this to logo, so logo fitte the width and not overflows. 
Then when you scrolling down na Logo gets smaller and smaller, and stays at the place, where navigations is.


After this when you scroll down, sections sticks on the top, but not exactly on the top but little bit more that the top of the page like 300px above if i remember :D

I didn't add to many features on this page, but still it's nice looking page, but not finished.
